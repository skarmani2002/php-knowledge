What is the difference between == and === in php?

The difference between the loosely == equal operator and the strict === identical operator is exactly explained in the manual:
$a == $b	Equal	TRUE if $a is equal to $b after type juggling.
$a === $b	Identical	TRUE if $a is equal to $b, and they are of the same type.
